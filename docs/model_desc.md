This explorable represents an online discussion space where topics compete for the attention of users. Using a few simple rules and attributes, we can show how certain topics emerge as hot discussion subjects over longer periods of time while most topics vanish after only a brief period. Furthermore, the explorable contains a shared political dimension for users and topics by which we can observe the effect of political leanings on the attention dynamics.

## This is how it works

The position of users (the little colored dots) and topics (the speech bubbles) encodes two meanings:

- **The horizontal space (x-axis)** is a one-dimensional **political spectrum**. You can think of it as the "left vs. right wing" distinction we often hear in the news.

- **The vertical space (y-axis)** represents equally spaced topic **categories**. Think of them as the major categories which appear on social media: geopolitics, climate, immigration, minority rights and so on. In each category, there can only be one topic, which can be thought of as a relevant news story or a hashtag.

Each user follows exactly one topic at a time which is shown by their current color and their position on the y-axis. When a user switches their topic of interest, they change their color accordingly and swiftly move to the corresponding topic category on the y-axis. Once there, they will slightly jiggle, perhaps representing a heated discussion around the target topic.
